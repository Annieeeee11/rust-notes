TALKING ABOUT HIGH ORDER FUNCTION ->

- A higher-order function is a function that:
- Takes another function as an argument, or
- Returns another function as its result.
- HOFs are often used with iterators and closures.
- they are used in "solana devlopment" very frequently 

--- Closure ---

- closures and things like map() or mini function that you write inside another function

eg =>  

let add = |a, b| a + b;    =>   This is the same as below but it's shorter and can be stored in a variable.

fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}

Another example: 

let square = |x| x * x;
println!("{}", square(5));  // prints 25

->  |x| means: "take one input called x"
->  x * x is the body — what it returns
- Closures are often used when you need to pass a function as a value.
